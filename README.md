# Rock Paper Scissors
## A syllabus project for The Odin Project fullstack web-dev course

A simple implimentation of the Rock Paper Scissors assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors), and my first *JS* project.  This is a first stage prototype, console-only with no array functionality. Updates to come.

### Best of five!

Play five rounds against the computer (ties don't count!), and the highest score at the end wins.
